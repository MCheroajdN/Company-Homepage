# Company Home Page
## Introduction
In this Codecademy project I was required to use flexbox to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company, to come up with what content to include for the company by using specification provided by Codecademy as in the requirement below. So I came up with this imagined company.

## REQUIREMENT
You’re going to build a company homepage for a real or imagined company. You’ll get to decide exactly what content to include for this company, but you should at least include:

A title and logo or splash image.
A mission statement or brief description of the company.
A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.
